# XMath
### An eXtended Math Library
This is a math library -- and soon to be CAS -- written in Python.  It implements structures found in abstract algebra and more.

Currently a learning project that incentivizes learning the math behind the implementation, XMath already has an intuitive interface that is actually meant to be invoked in interactive programming.  Eventually, matplotlib will be incorporated into this package, making plotting from the interpreter much easier.
